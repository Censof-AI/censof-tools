# Getting updates

**Two commands, in this order.** Open PowerShell:

```powershell
claude plugin marketplace update censof-tools
```

```powershell
claude plugin update grp-mcp@censof-tools
```

On macOS or Linux the Acumatica plugin is named differently:

```powershell
claude plugin update grp-mcp-mac@censof-tools
```

For the knowledge-base plugin it is the same shape, with the other name:

```powershell
claude plugin update censof-mcp@censof-tools
```

The first command is shared — one marketplace refresh covers both plugins.

Then **fully restart Claude Code** — the desktop app, the terminal, or both if
you use both. The update lands in one shared store; each running program still
has to be restarted to pick it up.

That is the whole procedure. The app can do the same from its Plugins page —
see [Updating from the app](#updating-from-the-app) — and the rest of this page
covers how to confirm it worked.

## One-time: the Acumatica plugin needs `uv` from 0.81.0-rc15 on

**If you are updating the Acumatica plugin from rc14 or earlier, install this
first.** Up to rc14 the Windows plugin carried its own program and needed
nothing. It no longer ships one — `uv` is what fetches the server and runs it.

```powershell
winget install astral-sh.uv
```

On macOS or Linux: `brew install uv`, or
`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`.

Then **close and reopen your terminal** — the installer adds a folder to your
PATH and an already-open window will not see it — and check:

```powershell
uv --version
```

**Why this is called out rather than left to fail:** if you update without `uv`
and restart, Claude tries to start the server, cannot, and you get **no
Acumatica tools and no error message**. Nothing on screen names the cause. If
that has already happened to you, it is not a broken install — install `uv`,
restart Claude, and everything comes back. Your connection settings are
untouched throughout.

You do **not** need Python. `uv` brings its own. The knowledge-base plugin
(`censof-mcp`) does not need `uv` at all — it calls a hosted service.

**Wondering what you just installed?** [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) lists every
release and what you will notice about it. The plugin list also shows a one-line
summary of the latest version in each plugin’s description.

## Updating from the app

The same update, without a terminal:

1. Open **Settings** from your account menu, bottom-left, and choose **Plugins**
   under **Customize**.
2. Click **Browse**, choose the **Code** tab, then **censof-tools**. Open the
   **⋯** menu beside it and choose **Check for updates**. Any plugin with a new
   version gets an orange dot.
3. Close the directory, open the plugin with the dot, and click **Update** — the
   button names the version it will move to.
4. If a warning says local changes will be overwritten, choose **Update anyway**.
   The file it names, under `.in_use\`, is Claude Code's own marker for a version
   in use, not anything of yours.
5. Fully restart Claude Code.

**If the button reads *"On latest version"* when a newer version exists**, the
app has not fetched it yet. It compares what you have installed against the copy
of the marketplace it last downloaded, and that copy refreshes only at step 2 or
when you run `claude plugin marketplace update censof-tools`.

If it still does not move after checking, use the two commands at the top of this
page — they are not affected. The button has also been reported stuck in Claude
Code itself:

- [#54276](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/54276) — Desktop
  fails to detect newer versions; the same *"On latest version"* tooltip.
  Closed as a duplicate, so it is tracked rather than fixed.
- [#45809](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/45809) — Update
  button unresponsive when the plugin version is outdated
- [#45810](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/45810) — marketplace
  update button disabled / not pressable
- [#48912](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/48912) — greyed out,
  reports "already up to date" after the marketplace was updated

This page recorded the same on 2 Sep 2026: Check for updates found the new
version, but the button stayed disabled. The next day the route above worked end
to end, 1.1.4 to 1.1.5, and on 21 Sep a button stuck on *"On latest version"*
came from a marketplace copy four days out of date. Keep the CLI installed for
the day it sticks:

```powershell
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

Then reopen PowerShell.

## Why the first command is not optional

`claude plugin marketplace update` fetches new commits from the repository.
`claude plugin update` installs what was fetched.

Until the marketplace is refreshed, the plugin page shows your installed version
as the latest — and it is telling the truth about what it has. Run both, in
order.

---

## If the tools vanish right after updating

Run the plugin's own command by hand. The reason only appears in what it prints,
which Claude does not show you:

```powershell
uvx --from "grp-mcp-plugin @ https://github.com/Censof-AI/censof-tools/releases/download/grp-mcp-v0.81.0rc40/grp_mcp_plugin-0.81.0rc40-py3-none-any.whl" grp-mcp
```

That is the line for 0.81.0-rc40. For any other version, copy the
`grp-mcp-plugin @ ...` line out of the plugin's `.mcp.json`.

A working server prints no error and waits for input: press Ctrl+C and restart
Claude. The first start after an update downloads the server from GitHub and the
libraries it uses from PyPI, so both have to be reachable from your PC. After
that first download, rc40 also started with the network cut off when this was
measured.

**On 0.81.0-rc39 or earlier** the usual cause was different: `uv` kept an old
copy of PyPI's list of versions and could not see the new one. The fix for that
is in [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) — "No Acumatica tools right after
updating the plugin".

## Confirming the update actually took

Two different things have to be true: the files on disk changed, and the
*running* server picked them up. A restart is what connects them.

**After restarting**, ask Claude:

> whoami

and read `grp_mcp_version` in the reply. That is the version actually serving
you — not what a settings page claims.

If it still shows the old version, Claude was not fully restarted. Closing a
conversation is not enough; quit the application.

---

## Your settings are not touched

Neither plugin keeps your settings inside itself. `censof-mcp` has none beyond
its token, which lives in your environment. For `grp-mcp`, `connections.json`
and `kb_server.json` live in `%USERPROFILE%\grp-mcp\`, outside the plugin. Updating replaces the program only. You do not need to
re-enter anything, and you do not need to re-run the setup.

*(This page is about the **plugin**, which serves Claude Code — desktop app and
terminal alike. If you instead run **Claude Desktop**, the separate chat app,
you have a `.mcpb` **extension**, and updating that is a different and worse
story: an update there has ended with the extension removed, reinstalled, and
its settings re-entered by hand. Write them down first. This is the main reason
the plugin is the recommended route.)*

---

## Going back to an earlier version

Old versions stay on disk under
`%USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\cache\censof-tools\grp-mcp\`, one folder per
version. If a new release causes a problem, say so and include the `whoami`
output — do not hand-edit that folder, as the installed-version record is kept
separately and editing one without the other leaves an inconsistent state.
