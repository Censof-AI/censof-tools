title GRP MCP - Edit Connections

rem ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
rem Opens the GRP MCP config page, pointed at the connections.json the SERVER
rem actually uses.
rem
rem Why a launcher: nothing about how the server starts is stable enough to write
rem into a document. It used to be a binary at a ~90-character path that people
rem mistyped, in a cache folder carrying the VERSION. As of 0.81.0rc15 it is not a
rem binary at all -- the plugin runs the server through uvx, and the version is
rem pinned inside the plugin's own .mcp.json: a version on PyPI up to 0.81.0rc39,
rem a link to a GitHub release of this repository from rc40. So this finds
rem whichever of those is present rather than naming one.

rem 1. Work out how to start the config page.
rem
rem uvx FIRST, when the plugin pins a version. That pin is the same string the
rem MCP server is launched with, so the config page is guaranteed to be the same
rem build as the server -- which the old exe-first order could not promise: after
rem an update the marketplace clone has no binary but a PREVIOUS version's cache
rem folder still does, and that stale exe would have won.

rem     names are checked: grp-mcp-mac is the same package under an older name.
rem
rem     The pin is pulled by stripping quotes, commas and spaces off the matched
rem     line rather than by splitting on the quote character. `delims="` inside a

rem 2. Find the connections.json the SERVER actually reads.
rem
rem The default moved on 2026-09-04, and the move was paid for. It used to be
rem %%LOCALAPPDATA%%\grp-mcp. Claude installs as an MSIX package, so the server it
rem launches sees %%LOCALAPPDATA%% as the package's LocalCache -- and an app update
rem RESET that container overnight, deleting a user's connections.json holding
rem twelve profiles including live client credentials. It was recovered only
rem because an unrelated copy happened to still be in a OneDrive recycle bin. The
rem folder had been re-CREATED rather than emptied, which is what a LocalCache
rem reset looks like.
rem
rem The 2026-09-03 version of this script made that WORSE: it taught the config
rem page to write INTO the container, so the page and the server finally agreed
rem -- on a location an app update can delete.
rem
rem %%USERPROFILE%%\grp-mcp sits outside AppData, so no container maps it and no
rem update reaches it. Verified by listing the same path from inside the
rem container and outside: both see the same files, where AppData\grp-mcp showed
rem files to one and an empty folder to the other.
rem
rem Existing installs are NOT moved. Their file is found where it already is, and
rem the server writes back to whatever it loaded, so nothing forks into two.
