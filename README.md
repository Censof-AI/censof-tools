# Censof tools for Claude

Two Claude Code plugins, and the documentation for both. Install once, and
updates arrive from git — no more emailed files.

| Plugin | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **`censof-mcp`** | Search the GRP knowledge base — 101,530 closed RFS tickets, the Acumatica documentation and the GRP manuals. Bundles the `rfs-analyze` skill. Read-only. |
| **`grp-mcp`** | Drive an Acumatica instance — read records, write them, run processes, diagnose failures. Talks to your own instance; credentials never leave your machine. Windows, macOS and Linux. Needs `uv`. |
| **`grp-mcp-mac`** | Superseded. `grp-mcp` is cross-platform as of 0.81.0-rc15, and this is now identical to it; it stays published so existing macOS installs keep updating. Install one *or* the other, never both. |

They are independent. Take one, the other, or both.

## Start here

**→ [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** — pick your plugin and follow that track.

The full documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/): install guides for each plugin,
the configuration reference, updating, troubleshooting, and a
[changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md) of what changed in each release. It also carries the
helper tools — `Set-KB-Token.cmd` and `Edit-Connections.cmd`.

Once you have added this marketplace, that folder is also on your own disk —
`claude plugin marketplace add` clones the whole repository, docs included, and
`claude plugin marketplace update` refreshes it:

```
Windows        %USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\censof-tools\docs\
macOS, Linux   ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/censof-tools/docs/
```

so the guides are there without a separate download, and the two `.cmd` helpers
are there too on Windows. (On macOS and Linux those scripts do not run — the
manual equivalents are in the guides; see
[docs/tools/README.md](docs/tools/README.md).)

Do not edit anything under that folder. It is a managed clone and every
`marketplace update` overwrites it.

---

## The short version

```powershell
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

```powershell
winget install Git.Git
```

```powershell
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Censof-AI/censof-tools.git
```

```powershell
claude plugin install censof-mcp@censof-tools
```

`grp-mcp` additionally needs `uv`, which fetches and runs the Acumatica server:

```powershell
winget install astral-sh.uv
```

Git comes first because `marketplace add` clones this repository with it; without
it the add fails with `Command 'git' not found`. Open a new PowerShell window
after installing it, and restart Claude Code if it was running, or neither will
find it. Swap in `grp-mcp@censof-tools` for the Acumatica plugin; `grp-mcp` needs
your Acumatica credentials as well, which
[docs/INSTALL-grp-mcp.md](docs/INSTALL-grp-mcp.md) walks through.

**On a Mac or Linux?** `grp-mcp` works there too now — follow
[docs/INSTALL-grp-mcp-mac.md](docs/INSTALL-grp-mcp-mac.md), which covers the
same steps with `brew install uv` in place of the `winget` line. Until
0.81.0-rc15 it bundled a Windows binary and had to be a separate plugin;
`grp-mcp-mac` still exists for anyone who installed it then. `censof-mcp` needs
no variant; it calls a hosted service and runs anywhere. Note the token tools
below are Windows scripts — the Mac equivalent is in
[docs/INSTALL-censof-mcp.md](docs/INSTALL-censof-mcp.md).

Then set your token by double-clicking `docs\tools\Set-KB-Token.cmd`, and restart
Claude Code.

> **Do not `setx` your token.** A command line is readable by every process
> running as you, and it lands in your PowerShell history file on disk. The tool
> above prompts for it instead, and sets both variable names it is read under.

## Your token is yours

It carries your name and your access level, and it is logged against you. Never
paste someone else's, and never share yours. Ask the OPEX team if you do not have
one — they start with `grpkb_`.

---

## Updates

```powershell
claude plugin marketplace update censof-tools
```

```powershell
claude plugin update grp-mcp@censof-tools
```

Both lines, in that order, then restart. The app's **Update** button works too,
once you have run **Check for updates** on the marketplace: until then it reads
"On latest version", because it compares against the copy of the marketplace it
last fetched. If it still will not move, the two lines above always work.
[docs/UPDATING.md](docs/UPDATING.md) walks through both.

> **Coming from `grp-mcp` 0.81.0-rc14 or earlier? Install `uv` first.**
>
> ```powershell
> winget install astral-sh.uv
> ```
>
> The plugin no longer carries its own program; `uv` fetches the server and runs
> it. Update without it and you get no Acumatica tools **and no
> error** — nothing on screen says why. Reopen your terminal afterwards so the
> PATH change takes. `brew install uv` on a Mac; `censof-mcp` does not need it.

## Which app gets these

Plugins serve **Claude Code** — the desktop app and the terminal share one plugin
store, so installing once covers both.

*Claude Desktop*, the separate chat app, does not use plugins at all.

| You use | Install |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code (desktop app or terminal), Cowork | these plugins |
| Claude Desktop **chat** | the `.mcpb` extension — plugins do not reach chat |

**Do not run both on one machine.** The `.mcpb` extension connects to the same
server, so you get every tool twice with no way to tell which answered. Keep the
`.mcpb` on that machine and skip the plugin, or the reverse — not both.

## If something goes wrong

Full symptom table in [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). The
four most common:

| What you see | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `Command 'git' not found` | Git is not installed, or Claude Code was already running when it was. `winget install Git.Git`, restart Claude Code, then add the marketplace again |
| Tools missing, or auth errors | Your token is not reaching the server. Run `Set-KB-Token.cmd`, then **fully restart** Claude Code — a running program keeps the environment it started with |
| `not permitted to …` | Not an install problem. Your token works; it lacks that access tier. Ask OPEX to add it |
| `/` menu shows nothing at all | You are on the home screen. Skills load once a session starts — send a message first, then look |

## For maintainers

`plugins/censof-mcp/skills/*/SKILL.md` is **generated**. Its source of truth is
`ElasticSearch-KB-Server/Operations/grpkb-connector/skills/`. Edit it there, then:

```bash
python Operations/sync_plugin.py
```

and commit this repo. Editing the copy here gets overwritten on the next sync.

`docs/` mirrors `packaging/` documentation in the **grp-mcp** repo where the two
overlap. When you change how the plugin is installed or configured, change it in
both — the drift that this move was meant to end.

**Every release needs three things, not one:** the version bumped in
`plugin.json`, an entry at the top of [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md)
written for the reader rather than the maintainer, and the `LATEST (...)`
sentence at the end of the plugin `description` updated to match. That sentence
is the only "what changed" anyone sees without leaving the plugin list.

**Never force-push this repo.** A client records the commit it synced, and
force-pushing strands every client that had synced against it, each needing a
manual remove-and-re-add. Withdraw a bad release with a follow-up commit instead.
